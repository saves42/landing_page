# Plumbus Landing Page

## Free Code Camp: Build a product landing page

### Project objectives
+ [x] My product landing page should have a header element with a corresponding id="header".
+ [x] I can see an image within the header element with a corresponding id="header-img". A company logo would make a good image here.
+ [x] Within the #header element I can see a nav element with a corresponding id="nav-bar".
+ [x] I can see at least three clickable elements inside the nav element, each with the class nav-link.
+ [x] When I click a .nav-link button in the nav element, I am taken to the corresponding section of the landing page.
+ [x] I can watch an embedded product video with id="video".
+ [x] My landing page has a form element with a corresponding id="form".
+ [x] Within the form, there is an input field with id="email" where I can enter an email address.
+ [x] The #email input field should have placeholder text to let the user know what the field is for.
+ [x] The #email input field uses HTML5 validation to confirm that the entered text is an email address.
+ [x] Within the form, there is a submit input with a corresponding id="submit".
+ [x] When I click the #submit element, the email is submitted to a static page (use this mock URL: https://www.freecodecamp.com/email-submit).
+ [x] The navbar should always be at the top of the viewport.
+ [x] My product landing page should have at least one media query.
+ [x] My product landing page should utilize CSS flexbox at least once.
